# 4DTicTacToeGame

# Here is a 4D Tic Tac Toe game that I implemented in some spare time over Christmas break. It's meant to be played with 2 players (AI
# to be added at some point in the future). It throws a neat spin on regular 2D Tic Tac Toe, and I initially learned about it from my
# professor during First Year Linear Algebra. 

# The game is more interesting to play and it should be played with a focus on 'exploring' the solution space for the game. It 
# emphasizes viewing a 4D hyper-cube as an array of 2D boards, and helps the player develop intuition for viewing abstract higher 
# dimensional structures (as well as thinking in higher dimensions). Have fun! :)
